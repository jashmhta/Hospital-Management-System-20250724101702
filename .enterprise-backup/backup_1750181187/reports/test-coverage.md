# Test Coverage Report for Hospital Management System

## Overview

The Hospital Management System codebase has significant test coverage issues, primarily due to syntax errors in the test files themselves. This report provides an analysis of the current test coverage and recommendations for improving it.

## Test Status

- **Total Test Suites**: 124
- **Passing Test Suites**: 11
- **Failing Test Suites**: 113
- **Total Tests**: 147
- **Passing Tests**: 143
- **Skipped Tests**: 4

## Common Test Failure Patterns

1. **Syntax Errors**: The majority of test failures are due to syntax errors, particularly:

   - Using semicolons instead of commas in object literals
   - Unterminated string literals
   - Incorrect function declarations
   - Missing closing braces

2. **TypeScript Errors**: Many test files contain TypeScript errors that prevent them from running:

   - Missing type annotations
   - Incorrect interface implementations
   - Type mismatches

3. **Jest Configuration Issues**: Multiple Jest configuration files are causing conflicts:
   - Both jest.config.js and jest.config.ts exist in the repository
   - Configuration needs to be explicitly selected with --config

## Passing Test Suites

The following test suites are currently passing:

1. **Authentication Tests**: Basic authentication functionality tests
2. **Notification Tests**: Tests for the notification system
3. **Barcode Tests**: Tests for barcode generation and scanning
4. **Security Service Tests**: Tests for security-related functionality

## Test Coverage by Module

### Core Modules

- **Database**: Limited test coverage
- **Authentication**: Good test coverage
- **Authorization**: Limited test coverage
- **Logging**: Limited test coverage

### Business Logic Modules

- **Patient Management**: Limited test coverage
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Limited test coverage
- **Billing**: Limited test coverage
- **Pharmacy**: Limited test coverage
- **Laboratory**: Limited test coverage

### UI Components

- **Form Components**: No test coverage
- **Layout Components**: No test coverage
- **Data Display Components**: No test coverage

## Recommendations for Improving Test Coverage

### 1. Fix Syntax Errors in Test Files

- Apply the same fixes to test files as to source files
- Focus on fixing object literal syntax (semicolons to commas)
- Fix unterminated string literals
- Fix function declarations

### 2. Implement Unit Tests for Core Modules

- Database connection and query functionality
- Authentication and authorization
- Logging and auditing
- Error handling

### 3. Implement Integration Tests for Business Logic

- Patient registration and management
- Appointment scheduling
- Billing and invoicing
- Pharmacy and medication management
- Laboratory test ordering and results

### 4. Implement UI Component Tests

- Form validation
- Data display
- User interactions
- Responsive design

### 5. Implement End-to-End Tests

- Critical user journeys
- Cross-module functionality
- Error scenarios

## Test Coverage Goals

| Module              | Current Coverage | Target Coverage |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Core Infrastructure | ~20%             | 90%             |
| Business Logic      | ~10%             | 80%             |
| UI Components       | ~5%              | 70%             |
| End-to-End          | ~2%              | 50%             |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Tests

3. Implement unit tests for logging and auditing
4. Implement unit tests for error handling

### Phase 3: Business Logic Tests

1. Implement unit tests for patient management
2. Implement unit tests for appointment scheduling
3. Implement unit tests for billing and invoicing
4. Implement unit tests for pharmacy and medication management
5. Implement unit tests for laboratory test ordering and results

### Phase 4: UI Component Tests

1. Implement unit tests for form components
2. Implement unit tests for layout components
3. Implement unit tests for data display components

### Phase 5: End-to-End Tests

1. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
2. Implement end-to-end tests for cross-module functionality
3. Implement end-to-end tests for error scenarios

## Conclusion

The Hospital Management System codebase has significant test coverage issues, primarily due to syntax errors in the test files themselves. By following the recommendations outlined in this report, the test coverage can be significantly improved, leading to a more robust and reliable application.
