```

This script analyzes the codebase for TypeScript errors and generates reports in this directory.

### Fix TypeScript Errors Script

```bash
./scripts/fix-typescript-errors.sh
```

This script attempts to fix common TypeScript errors in the codebase.

### Parallel Fix Script

```bash
./scripts/parallel-fix.sh
```

./scripts/quality-check.sh
```

This script checks the quality of the codebase after fixes have been applied.

## How to Use These Reports

1. **Understand the Issues**: Use the error analysis reports to understand the types and patterns of errors in the codebase.
2. **Prioritize Fixes**: Use the files with most errors report to prioritize which files to fix first.
3. **Apply Fixes**: Use the fix scripts to automatically fix common errors, then manually fix the remaining issues.
4. **Verify Fixes**: Use the quality check script to verify that fixes have been applied correctly.
5. **Track Progress**: Generate new reports after applying fixes to track progress.
