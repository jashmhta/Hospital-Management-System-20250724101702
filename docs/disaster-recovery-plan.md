# Hospital Management System Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery plan for the Hospital Management System. The plan is designed to ensure business continuity in the event of system failures, data loss, or other catastrophic events. The disaster recovery plan has been engineered to meet the following objectives:

- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): < 5 minutes
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): < 1 minute
- System Availability Target: 99.99% uptime

## Critical Systems and Components

The following systems and components are considered critical for the operation of the Hospital Management System:

1. **Database Tier**
   - PostgreSQL primary and replica databases
   - Redis Cluster for caching and session management
   - Kafka for event streaming

2. **Application Tier**
   - API Gateway
   - Core Microservices (Patient, Appointment, Billing, Pharmacy, etc.)
   - Authentication and Authorization Services

3. **Frontend Tier**
   - Web Application
   - Mobile API Endpoints

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Kubernetes Cluster
   - Networking and Load Balancers
   - Storage Systems

## Disaster Recovery Strategy

### Multi-Region Deployment

The HMS is deployed across multiple regions to ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities:

1. **Primary Region**: US East (N. Virginia)
2. **Secondary Region**: US West (Oregon)
3. **Tertiary Region**: Europe (Frankfurt)

Each region is configured with a complete and independent deployment of the HMS, with data replication between regions.

### Data Replication and Backup

#### Database Replication

- **PostgreSQL**: Synchronous streaming replication within region, asynchronous cross-region replication
- **Redis**: Redis Cluster with sharding across availability zones, cross-region replication
- **Kafka**: Multi-region mirroring with MirrorMaker 2.0

#### Backup Strategy

1. **Continuous Backup**
   - PostgreSQL: WAL (Write-Ahead Log) archiving to S3
   - Point-in-time recovery capability with 5-minute RPO

2. **Scheduled Backups**
   - Full database backups every 24 hours
   - Incremental backups every hour
   - All backups encrypted and stored in multiple regions

3. **Backup Testing**
   - Weekly automated restore testing to validate backup integrity
   - Monthly full disaster recovery simulation

### Automatic Failover

#### Database Failover

- **Within-Region Failover**
  - Automated failover using PostgreSQL streaming replication
  - Managed by Patroni cluster with consensus through etcd
  - Average failover time: 10-15 seconds

- **Cross-Region Failover**
  - Orchestrated by Kubernetes operators
  - DNS updates through Route53 with health checks
  - Average failover time: 45-60 seconds

#### Application Failover

- **Kubernetes Pod Failover**
  - Health checks trigger automatic pod replacement
  - Anti-affinity rules ensure proper distribution
  - Average failover time: 5-10 seconds

- **Regional Failover**
  - Global load balancer with health checks
  - Traffic shifting based on regional health
  - Average failover time: 30-45 seconds

### Event-Driven Architecture for Data Consistency

The HMS leverages event-driven architecture to ensure data consistency during recovery:

1. **Event Sourcing**
   - All state changes are recorded as events
   - Events stored in Kafka with cross-region replication
   - State can be rebuilt from event stream

2. **Event Replay**
   - Recovery process includes event replay to restore system state
   - Idempotent event handling ensures safe replay
   - Event versioning supports backward compatibility

## Disaster Scenarios and Recovery Procedures

### Scenario 1: Single Node Failure

**Impact**: Minimal, handled by Kubernetes self-healing

**Recovery Procedure**:
1. Kubernetes detects node failure through health checks
2. Affected pods are automatically rescheduled to healthy nodes
3. Services remain available through load balancing

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 1-2 minutes

### Scenario 2: Database Primary Failure

**Impact**: Potential brief interruption to write operations

**Recovery Procedure**:
1. Patroni detects primary database failure
2. Automated promotion of most up-to-date replica to primary
3. Service endpoints updated to point to new primary
4. Failed node is recovered and rejoins as replica

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 10-30 seconds

### Scenario 3: Availability Zone Failure

**Impact**: Minimal if properly distributed across AZs

**Recovery Procedure**:
1. Load balancers direct traffic to healthy availability zones
2. Kubernetes reschedules pods to remaining AZs
3. Database cluster elects new primary if needed
4. Capacity is automatically scaled in remaining AZs

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 2-3 minutes

### Scenario 4: Regional Failure

**Impact**: Potential brief service degradation during failover

**Recovery Procedure**:
1. Global load balancer detects regional health deterioration
2. Traffic is gradually shifted to healthy regions
3. DNS records are updated to point to failover region
4. Database replication promotes secondary region to primary
5. Event replay ensures data consistency

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 3-5 minutes

### Scenario 5: Ransomware or Data Corruption

**Impact**: Potential data loss if not detected early

**Recovery Procedure**:
1. Isolate affected systems by network segregation
2. Identify point-in-time before corruption
3. Restore databases from backup to that point
4. Replay events from Kafka to recover recent transactions
5. Verify data integrity before restoring service

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 15-30 minutes

## Disaster Recovery Testing

Regular testing is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the disaster recovery plan:

### Testing Schedule

1. **Automated Component Testing**
   - Daily automated failover testing for individual components
   - Weekly database restore testing

2. **Regional Failover Drills**
   - Monthly regional failover drills during off-peak hours
   - Simulated AZ and regional outages

3. **Full Disaster Recovery Simulation**
   - Quarterly full DR simulations
   - Includes all recovery procedures and validation

### Testing Metrics

The following metrics are tracked during DR testing:

1. **Recovery Time**: Time from failure to full service restoration
2. **Data Loss**: Amount of data lost during recovery (should be zero)
3. **Service Degradation**: Percentage of reduced system capacity during recovery
4. **Error Rate**: Increase in error rates during and after recovery

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Disaster Recovery Team

1. **DR Coordinator**
   - Oversees the entire DR process
   - Makes critical decisions during recovery
   - Communicates with stakeholders

2. **Database Recovery Team**
   - Manages database failover and recovery
   - Verifies data integrity post-recovery

3. **Application Recovery Team**
   - Manages application service recovery
   - Validates application functionality

4. **Infrastructure Recovery Team**
   - Manages Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure
   - Ensures networking and security during recovery

5. **Communication Coordinator**
   - Manages internal and external communications
   - Provides status updates to stakeholders

## Continuous Improvement

The disaster recovery plan is subject to continuous improvement:

1. **Post-Incident Analysis**
   - Detailed analysis after each incident or drill
   - Root cause identification
   - Procedural improvements

2. **Technology Updates**
   - Regular review of DR technologies
   - Adoption of new resilience patterns
   - Infrastructure as Code updates

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Monthly review and update of DR documentation
   - Runbook testing and validation
