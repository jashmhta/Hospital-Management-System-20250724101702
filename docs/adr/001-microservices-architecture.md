# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The Hospital Management System is a large and complex application that needs to be scalable, resilient, and maintainable. A monolithic architecture would be difficult to develop, deploy, and scale.

**Decision:** We have decided to adopt a microservices architecture for the HMS. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific business capability, such as patient management, appointment scheduling, or billing. The services will communicate with each other using a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns.

**Consequences:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Improved Scalability:** Each microservice can be scaled independently, allowing us to optimize resource usage.
    *   **Increased Resilience:** The failure of a single microservice will not bring down the entire system.
    *   **Faster Development Cycles:** Teams can develop, deploy, and iterate on their services independently.
    *   **Technology Diversity:** Each microservice can be implemented using the most appropriate technology stack.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Increased Complexity:** A microservices architecture is more complex to design, develop, and manage than a monolithic architecture.
    *   **Operational Overhead:** We will need to invest in a robust infrastructure for deploying, monitoring, and managing our microservices.
    *   **Data Consistency:** Maintaining data consistency across multiple services can be a challenge.
