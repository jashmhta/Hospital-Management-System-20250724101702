# Pulse Prisma Client extension

This is the package for the [Prisma Client extension](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions?utm_source=github&utm_medium=pulse-readme) that enables usage of [Prisma Pulse](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/pulse?utm_source=github&utm_medium=pulse-readme).

## What is Prisma Pulse?

[Prisma Pulse](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/pulse?utm_source=github&utm_medium=pulse-readme) is a managed Change Data Capture (CDC) service that makes it easy to react to changes in your databases with type-safe model streams.

It enables developers to build real-time apps by streaming database changes into their application in a type-safe way — with just a few lines of code:

```ts
// 1. Subscribe to all changes on the `User` table
const stream = await prisma.user.stream();

// 2. Wait for changes to happen in the DB so that new events arrive
for await (let event of stream) {
  // 3. Do something with an event, e.g. log the its details to the terminal
  console.log(`Something happened in the database: `, event);
}
```

Here is an overview of the main features Prisma Pulse provides:

- Type-safe reactions to database changes
- Delivery guarantees for events: "at least once" and in the "right order"
- Resumable event streams in case your server goes down
- Unidirectional data flow via Change Data Capture (CDC)
- Great DX integrated with usage of Prisma ORM (easy setup, development and maintenance)
- Compatibility with your existing database
- Insights dashboard, so you can view and understand all database events captured by Pulse

## Important

### Using [`"moduleResolution": "bundler"`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/reference.html#bundler)

The Prisma Pulse extension offers separate implementations tailored for various runtimes, such as Node.js and Cloudflare Workers. If you're using [bundler moduleResolution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/reference.html#bundler) in your TSConfig, you must also explicitly set [customConditions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#customConditions) to either `node` or `workerd` depending on your target runtime. This will instruct TypeScript to match the correct type definitions of the Prisma Pulse extension, as well as any other packages that expose multiple entrypoints.

```js
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...other options
    "target": "es2022",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "customConditions": ["workerd"] // or "node"
  }
}
```
