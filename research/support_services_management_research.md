## Repository Architecture Analysis

The HMS repository follows a modern web application architecture using Next.js for the frontend and a combination of RESTful APIs and database services for the backend. The repository is structured to support modular development, with clear separation of concerns between different functional areas.

### Key Components

- **Frontend**: Next.js application with React components, organized by feature modules
- **Backend**: API routes organized by domain, with service layers for business logic
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, with models defined in schema.prisma
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user authentication and authorization
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests

### Integration Points

The Support Services Management module will need to integrate with several existing components:

1. **User Management**: For role-based access control and staff assignment
2. **Patient Management**: For associating services with specific patients
3. **Location Management**: For tracking service locations within the facility
4. **Notification System**: For alerts and updates on service requests
5. **Reporting System**: For analytics and operational metrics

### Development Patterns

The repository follows consistent patterns that should be maintained in the new module:

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic encapsulated in service classes
2. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstracted through repository interfaces
3. **Controller-Service-Repository**: Clear separation between API controllers, business services, and data access
4. **SOLID Principles**: Emphasis on single responsibility and interface segregation
