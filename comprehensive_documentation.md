### Design Patterns

The HMS codebase adheres to several well-established design patterns to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability. These patterns provide a structured approach to solving common software design problems.

#### Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern abstracts the data layer from the business logic, providing a clean API for data access. This allows for easier testing, changes in data storage technologies, and improved separation of concerns. In HMS, repositories are responsible for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on specific entities.

```typescript
interface IPatientRepository {
	create(patient: Patient): Promise<Patient>;
	findById(id: string): Promise<Patient | null>;
	update(id: string, updates: Partial<Patient>): Promise<Patient>;
	delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}

class PatientRepository implements IPatientRepository {
	constructor(private db: IDatabaseAdapter) {}

	async create(patient: Patient): Promise<Patient> {
		const encryptedPatient = await this.encryption.encrypt(patient);
		return this.db.create("patients", encryptedPatient);
	}
}
```

#### Service Layer Pattern

The Service Layer pattern encapsulates the business logic of the application, acting as an intermediary between the presentation layer (e.g., API controllers) and the data access layer (e.g., repositories). Services orchestrate operations across multiple repositories and enforce business rules.

```typescript
class PatientService {
	constructor(
		private repository: IPatientRepository,
		private encryption: IEncryptionService,
		private audit: IAuditService
	) {}

	async createPatient(data: CreatePatientDto): Promise<Patient> {
		await this.validatePatientData(data);
		const patient = await this.repository.create(data);
		await this.audit.log("PATIENT_CREATED", { patientId: patient.id });
		return patient;
	}
}
```

#### Event-Driven Architecture

The HMS utilizes an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to enable loose coupling between microservices and facilitate asynchronous communication. Services publish events when significant changes occur, and other services can subscribe to these events to react accordingly. This pattern enhances scalability and responsiveness.

```typescript
class EventBus {
	async publish(event: DomainEvent): Promise<void> {
		await this.messageQueue.publish(event.type, event.payload);
		await this.audit.log("EVENT_PUBLISHED", { eventType: event.type });
	}
}
```




### Database Design

The database design in HMS is tailored to support the microservices architecture, with each service potentially having its own dedicated database or schema. This approach ensures data autonomy, simplifies scaling, and minimizes inter-service dependencies. PostgreSQL is the primary relational database used across the system, often complemented by Redis for caching and message queuing.

#### Patient Management Schema

The `patients` table is central to the Patient Management Service, storing core demographic and contact information. Sensitive data fields are encrypted at the field level to ensure HIPAA compliance.

```sql
CREATE TABLE patients (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    encrypted_personal_info BYTEA NOT NULL,
    encrypted_contact_info BYTEA NOT NULL,
    encrypted_insurance_info BYTEA,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

CREATE INDEX idx_patients_created_at ON patients(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_patients_active ON patients(is_active);
```

#### EHR Schema

The `clinical_notes` table within the EHR Service stores detailed clinical documentation. Similar to patient data, the content of clinical notes is encrypted to protect patient privacy.

```sql
CREATE TABLE clinical_notes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    patient_id UUID REFERENCES patients(id),
    provider_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    encounter_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    encrypted_content BYTEA NOT NULL,
    icd10_codes TEXT[],
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_clinical_notes_patient ON clinical_notes(patient_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_clinical_notes_provider ON clinical_notes(provider_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_clinical_notes_date ON clinical_notes(created_at);
```




### Security Architecture

Security is a paramount concern in the Hospital Management System, given the sensitive nature of healthcare data. The HMS implements a multi-layered security architecture to protect against various threats and ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

#### Multi-Layer Security

1.  **Network Security**: Implemented through TLS 1.3 for secure communication, VPN access for authorized personnel, and robust firewall rules to control network traffic.
2.  **Application Security**: Focuses on preventing common web vulnerabilities through rigorous input validation, protection against SQL injection, and secure coding practices.
3.  **Data Security**: Achieved through field-level AES-256 encryption for Protected Health Information (PHI) and sensitive data, along with a secure key rotation strategy.
4.  **Access Control**: Enforced using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have access to the resources necessary for their roles.
5.  **Audit Security**: Comprehensive and immutable audit logs track all significant activities within the system, enabling tamper detection and forensic analysis for security incidents.

#### Encryption Strategy

The encryption strategy in HMS is designed to protect sensitive patient data at rest and in transit. Field-level encryption is applied to PHI, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, the sensitive data remains unreadable without the encryption keys.

```typescript
class EncryptionService {
	async encryptPHI(data: any): Promise<string> {
		const key = await this.keyManagement.getCurrentKey();
		const cipher = crypto.createCipher("aes-256-gcm", key);
		let encrypted = cipher.update(JSON.stringify(data), "utf8", "hex");
		encrypted += cipher.final("hex");
		const tag = cipher.getAuthTag();
		return JSON.stringify({ encrypted, iv: cipher.getIV().toString("hex"), tag: tag.toString("hex") });
	}

	async decryptPHI(encryptedData: string): Promise<any> {
		const { encrypted, iv, tag } = JSON.parse(encryptedData);
		const key = await this.keyManagement.getCurrentKey();
		const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv("aes-256-gcm", key, Buffer.from(iv, "hex"));
		decipher.setAuthTag(Buffer.from(tag, "hex"));
		let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, "hex", "utf8");
		decrypted += decipher.final("utf8");
		return JSON.parse(decrypted);
	}
}
```




## API Documentation

The Hospital Management System exposes a comprehensive set of RESTful APIs to facilitate interaction between its various microservices and external applications. All API endpoints are designed with security, performance, and ease of use in mind. This section details the authentication mechanisms, core API functionalities, error handling, and rate limiting policies.

### Authentication

#### JWT Token Authentication

All API endpoints in the HMS require JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, unless explicitly stated otherwise. This mechanism ensures that only authenticated and authorized users or services can access the system's resources. Upon successful login, an access token and a refresh token are issued.

**Authentication Header:**

To authenticate API requests, the obtained JWT access token must be included in the `Authorization` header of each request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

**Login Endpoint:**

Users or client applications can obtain JWT tokens by sending a POST request to the login endpoint with their credentials. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) codes are required if MFA is enabled for the user.

```http
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@hospital.com",
  "password": "securepassword",
  "mfaCode": "123456" // Optional, required if MFA is enabled
}
```

**Successful Login Response:**

Upon successful authentication, the API returns an access token, a refresh token, and basic user information, including their assigned role and permissions.

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"data": {
		"accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
		"refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
		"user": {

			"email": "user@hospital.com",
			"role": "doctor",
			"permissions": ["read_patients", "write_prescriptions"]
		}
	}
}
```

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

For enhanced security, the HMS supports Multi-Factor Authentication. Users can set up MFA through a dedicated endpoint, which typically returns a QR code and a secret key for use with authenticator applications.

```http
POST /api/auth/mfa/setup
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>

Response:
{
  "qrCode": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...",

## Deployment

Deploying the Hospital Management System involves setting up the necessary infrastructure and configuring the application for various environments. The HMS is designed for cloud-native deployments, leveraging containerization and orchestration technologies to ensure scalability, high availability, and efficient resource utilization.

### Production Deployment

For production environments, the HMS is primarily deployed on Kubernetes, a powerful container orchestration system. Kubernetes provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The `k8s/` directory in the repository contains the necessary Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) to define the deployment of each microservice, along with their associated services, ingresses, and configurations.

To deploy the HMS to a Kubernetes cluster, follow these general steps:

1.  **Apply Kubernetes Manifests**: Use `kubectl apply` to deploy all the defined resources to your Kubernetes cluster. This command will create deployments, services, config maps, secrets, and other necessary components.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/
    ```

2.  **Verify Deployment**: After applying the manifests, verify that all pods and services are running correctly within the specified namespace (e.g., `hospital-system`).

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n hospital-system
    kubectl get services -n hospital-system
    kubectl get deployments -n hospital-system
    ```

3.  **Run Health Checks**: Once the services are up and running, perform health checks to ensure that the application is responsive and functioning as expected. This typically involves making a request to a designated health endpoint.

    ```bash
    curl -f https://api.hospital.com/health
    ```

    (Note: Replace `https://api.hospital.com/health` with the actual health endpoint URL of your deployed API Gateway or a specific service.)

### Environment Support

The HMS supports various environments to cater to different stages of the software development lifecycle:
